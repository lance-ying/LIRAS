You are observing an astronaut exploring planet with alien terrains, which is divided into a 7 by 7 grid.
The terrains have different colors and different-colored terrains may be more or less exhausting to cross for the astronaut. 
The astronaut can cross all terrains, even if it's exhausting.
There is one terrain type in the map, which is grayterrain.
At each scenario, the astronaut needs to walk to the spaceship.
Sometimes care packages are dropped from above and the astronaut can pick them up.
There are two unique care packages: ['whitecube-package', 'orangecylinder-package']. 
The astronaut don't actually need the care packages. They can go directly to the spaceship, or they can pick one up.
The astronaut cannot pick up more than 1 care packages.
The astronaut can perform the following actions: up, down, left, right, and pickup.

The astronaut always has a map. So they know all about the packages and the care packages.
Your task is to judge how easy/exhausting it is for the astronauts to cross each terrain, and how much they like each care package.
