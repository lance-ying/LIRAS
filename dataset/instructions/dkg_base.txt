You're watching a player in a treasure game. There are four unique gems in the game, gem-A, gem-B, gem-C, and gem-D. The human player's goal is to possess exactly one target gem.
A gem may be locked behind doors, which can be unlocked by keys. Each door and key has a color. A door can be unlocked by a key of the same color (i.e. a player needs a blue key to unlock a blue door). Each key can be used once.
The human player cannot pass through a locked door.
The player needs to be adjacent to objects (doors, keys, gems) in order to interact with them. 
The map consists of black and white spaces. The black spaces are barriers, and players can only move on the white spaces. Players have a full view of the map at all times.
The player can perform the following actions: move up, down, left, or right; pick up objects; and unlock doors.
Your task is to watch and figure out which gem the player is trying to collect based on observations of the player's actions.
