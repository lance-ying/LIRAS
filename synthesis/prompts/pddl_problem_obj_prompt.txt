Your job is to synthesis the object section of the PDDL problem file, based on the provided PDDL domain definition and the natural langauge description of the problem file.

Make sure you do not repeat any objects that have already been defined as constants in the PDDL domain file.

Please respond with a json format, example:

Input:

pddl domain definition: 

(:types 
        ball plate - item
        agent item - object
    )


objects from visuals: ["player", "plate1", "plate2", "plate3", "baseball", "basketabll"]

Output:

{"objects": "(:objects plate1 plate2 plate3 - plate)"}
