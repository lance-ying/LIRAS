Your task is to take an image of a cell in a gridworld, then output a json file describing the object in the cell, using pddl, based on the pddl domain definition.

There can be multiple objects in the cell, please make sure you represent them all.

The location should be set with xloc and yloc, using placeholder $i and $j for the values. Please also remember to add relevant attributes such as color and shapes if applicable.

Example:

Input:

Instruction: There are pins and balls on the table. The items can be used or new. The pins can have a circle or square shape.


object_types: 
{
    "generic_objects":  ["pin"],
    "unique_objects": ["tennisball", "basketball", "baseball"],
    "agent": ["human"]
}

pddl_predicates: (isShape ?p - pin ?s - shape) (isNew ?i - item)


Image: [insert image of the cell showing a new circle pin and a baseball on a white square]

Output:

{
"object_name": ["pin", "baseball"]
"object_pddl_str": "(= (yloc pin) $i) \n(= (xloc pin) $j) \n(isShape pin circle) \n(isNew pin) \n(= (yloc baseball) $i) \n(= (xloc baseball) $j)\n "
}

if currently there is no pin, then your output for object name would instead be : "object_name": ["pin1", "baseball"]

if none of the objects are present (please do not count cell type, such as whitespace in this case), then output:
{
"object_name": []
"object_pddl_str": ""
}

if you are classifying objects that have shapes and colors, you must include those attributes. Doors are locked by default.
