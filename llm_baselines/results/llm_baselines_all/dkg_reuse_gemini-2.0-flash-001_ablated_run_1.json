Since the player picked up key11 and moved up, it is unlikely the player intends to unlock door2. Given this, we can estimate the likelihood for each gem.\nGem-A: Requires traversing up the map, which the player is not currently doing.\nGem-B: Requires moving to the left of the map.\nGem-C: Requires moving to the right of the map. Given the player's location and action, it is difficult to determine if they are going for Gem-A, Gem-B, or Gem-C.\nGem-D: It is highly unlikely the player is trying to collect Gem-D as it has been marked as (-1, -1), meaning it has been collected already.\n\nSince the player has picked up the blue key, it's likely aiming for gem A, B, or C. But given that it only moved vertically, it seems more likely the player will eventually go to A or C which will involve a longer horizontal move.
