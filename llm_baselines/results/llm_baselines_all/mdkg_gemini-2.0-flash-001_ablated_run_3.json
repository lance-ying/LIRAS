Since human picked up a red key, and then human moved to the gem B which require the agent to open door2 using a red key. Now that we analyze the current locations and known information, it can be concluded that the goal must be gem B.\n\nAnswer: [10, 90, 5, 5]",
  "mdkg_26": "The human starts at (2,3) and picks up the red key at (4,5). Gem A is behind a blue door. Gem B is behind a red door and a blue door. Gem C is behind a red door and a blue door. Gem D is behind a blue door and a red door. The human picks up the red key, which is key3. Gem A requires a blue key. Gem B is next to a red door, and also blocked by a blue door. Gem C is blocked by a blue and red door. Gem D is blocked by a blue and red door. Since the human picked up the red key first and is heading downwards, it seems that the robot will pick up the blue key. Gems B, C, and D are more likely than Gem A, but the human will need to pick up another blue key. The robot is located at the bottom of the map. Since the human picked up the red key, gems C and D are more likely than B. We can see the locations of keys (key1, key2, key3, key4, key5, key6, key7, key8, key9). The robot might need to pick up the blue key to unlock either B, C, or D. However, C and D look the most likely so far.\n\nConsidering the human's trajectory after picking up the red key, they are moving downwards. Gem A requires a blue key, but the human has a red key. Gems B, C, and D all require both red and blue keys. Gem B is to the west, whereas C and D are to the south. Since the human is moving south, Gems C and D are more likely than B. Since the robot is closer to Gem D than Gem C, let's say they have equal probability.\n\n[10, 20, 35, 35]\nAnswer: [10,20,35,35]",
  "mdkg_27": "The human starts at (2,3). The robot starts at (7,6). The human picks up the red key at (4,5).\n\nGem A is at (2,10). Gem B is at (7,1). Gem C is at (9,1). Gem D is at (9,10).\n\nThe human moves down to (3,3), (4,3), picks up key3 at (4,5), moves down to (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5) and then left to (9,4). \n\nGem C is at (9,1) and Gem D is at (9,10). Gem B is at (7,1) which is on the left side of the human and Gem D is on the right side.\n\nIt seems more probable that the human wants to reach Gem C, since it is heading to the left side. Gem D is also somewhat probable, but is on the opposite side of the human agent.\n\nTherefore:\n\nGem A: Very unlikely.\nGem B: Somewhat likely.\nGem C: Likely.\nGem D: Somewhat likely.\n\n```\nAnswer: [5, 40, 45, 10]\n```",
  "mdkg_28": "The human starts at (2,3). It moves down twice to (4,3) and then right four times to (4,7).\n\nGem A is at (2,10) and requires going up, then right past a blue door which needs the blue key at (1,8).\nGem B is at (7,1) and requires going down and left past a red and blue door. The red key is at (4,5).\nGem C is at (9,1) and requires going down and left past two red doors and a blue door. \nGem D is at (9,10) and requires going right and down past a red and blue door. Also requires a blue key at (7,10).\n\nThe human is moving towards the right side of the grid. This suggests gem A or D are possible goals.\nThe robot is in the lower area near the red key at (4,5), but the human does not go towards it.\nSince the human went right it might go for gem A. But, the robot being near the bottom-right blue key might indicate a plan towards gem D.\n\nSince the human has not made any attempt to get keys it may be going to A.\n\n[70, 10, 10, 10]\nAnswer: [70, 10, 10, 10]",
  "mdkg_29": "The human starts at (4,9). The robot starts at (6,11).\n\nGem A is at (1,11). To reach gem A, the human must go north. It looks like the human took the \"left-white\" action several times. \n\nGem B is at (4,1). To reach gem B, the human must go west. The sequence of actions \"left-white\" indicates the human is trying to move to the west.\n\nGem C is at (6,1). To reach gem C, the human must go south-west. The sequence of actions \"left-white\" and the robot moving down indicates the human is trying to move to the south-west, possibly to collect Gem C.\n\nThe robot moves down a few steps, perhaps planning to pick up the green key and unlock the green door. This would provide a path toward Gem C. The human moves left. So Gem C is possible. \nGem B also seems likely since the human moves to the left several times. \nGem A seems unlikely.\n\nAnswer: [5, 45, 50]",
  "mdkg_30": "The human starts at (4, 9). The sequence of actions is right, right, up, up. This leads the human to position (2, 11), which is right next to Gem A at (1, 11). There is no movement towards Gem B or Gem C. Therefore, the human-robot team is most likely trying to collect Gem A.\n\nAnswer: [100, 0, 0]",
  "mdkg_31": "The robot is moving towards the blue key and picks it up. The blue key unlocks the door to Gem B. Therefore, it's highly likely the goal is gem B. Gem A doesn't require any key, and Gem C needs a red key. The robot didn't move towards the red or green key.\n\nAnswer: [0, 100, 0]"
