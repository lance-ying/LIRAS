Gem D is behind one red door.\nSince the player picked up the key at (10,7), and moved up, they may intend to open doors to the north, and gems A, B, and C are north of the current location of the player. The actions show that the player is moving towards the upper portion of the grid. The player has a blue key and can reach gems A, B, and C using it. However, gem D requires a red key that the player does not have and is also to the south.
