To unlock door1, a key is needed, and Gem A itself is located at (1,12). The player has collected key4, a red key. Key7 is a blue key collected closer to the player than GemA, and the player may be going to use the blue key for another lock.\n\n*   **Gem B:** Requires going west, unlocking door2 and door3. Gem B is located at (6,1) and can be accessed through doors that require either keys from the right. The player has collected a red key that can unlock blue doors.\n\n*   **Gem C:** Requires going east, possibly unlocking door4 and door5. Gem C is at (6,12). The player has collected both red and blue keys, and the right path seems to be east.\n\n*   **Gem D:** Gem D is not placed in the graph. It's hard to go there.\n\nGiven that the player moved down to collect key7, then moved back up and to the right to collect key4, this path seems to be less intuitive than heading directly towards A, B, or C. Since player picked key4 which is red, and is to the right of the player now. Also, C is more likely than B since player is initially on the right side.\n\nBased on initial position (7, 7) and the path so far (down twice, pick up key7, up once, right once, pick up key4): Given that both red and blue keys were collected the end goal would probably need both. Gem C seems a viable option.\n\nNow to consider each gem's likelihood:\nA: 20 The player picked up keys far to the south.\nB: 15 Similar situation to gem A.

It is difficult to infer the goal at this stage, but picking up a blue key suggests gems A, B, and C are more likely. Gem D requires opening a red door which is less likely given the player just picked up a blue key. However, it is possible the player picks up multiple keys.\n\nGiven the player location and first action, it is unlikely that the player is directly going for Gem A or Gem B, since both are far away in opposite directions. The player goes down and picks up a blue key. It is possible the player wants to unlock door4 or door5. door4 is blue and door5 is red.
