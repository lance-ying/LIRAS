It's very likely that there's an error in the trace and the player has not picked up key1. It is slightly more probable that the player is going to gem A, as it is at the top.\n\nGiven the trace error, it is harder to infer the goal. Let's assume the trace is correct. The player picked up key1.\nIf the player wants Gem A, the player needs key1 to unlock door1, so the player might be going for Gem A.\nIf the player wants Gem B, the player doesn't need key1, but the player is near key1, so the player might be going for gem B after visiting key1.\nIf the player wants Gem C or Gem D, the player doesn't need key1.
