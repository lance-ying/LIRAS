So it is equally likely for it to be MexicanTruck, LebaneseTruck or no truck. Therefore we set them all to 4.\n\nAnswer: [5, 3, 5, 4, 4, 4]",
  "foodtruck_64": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe student starts on the right side of a building. They can see the LebaneseTruck. The actions taken by the student are right, down, down, and down, placing them at the bottom right next to the LebaneseTruck. Based on the student's actions, we can infer the following:\n1.  The student ends at the LebaneseTruck. This means they probably liked that truck the most.\n2.  Since the student went all the way down, we can infer they didn't like the KoreanTruck as much.\n3.  Since the student didn't bother to find out if MexicanTruck existed, we can infer that the student likes it the least, or they didn't have any opinion.\n\nTherefore, we can assume the student's preferences are: LebaneseTruck > KoreanTruck > MexicanTruck. Let's assign likert values based on this.\n\n1. KoreanTruck: A moderate like, let's say 4.\n2. MexicanTruck: Not much preference, let's say 2.\n3. LebaneseTruck: Liked a lot, let's say 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the student's initial beliefs about what's behind the building. Since the problem doesn't provide any priors, let's assume the student gives a similar probability to the other foodtrucks.\n1.  MexicanTruck: Possible, but no evidence, so let's say 3.\n2.  LebaneseTruck: Possible, but no evidence, so let's say 3.\n3.  No Truck: Also possible, but since two other trucks are possible, let's put it at 3.\n\nNow, after observing LebaneseTruck, let's revisit the student's initial belief about what's behind the building. Since the student decides to move downwards to the LebaneseTruck, this suggests, the student is more curious about what other truck is at the other side of building than no truck at all.\n\n1.  MexicanTruck: 4\n2.  LebaneseTruck: 3\n3.  No Truck: 2\n\nOkay, the above answer is wrong, since the student ends up at LebaneseTruck, the student must like it better. Hence:\n\n1. KoreanTruck: A moderate like, let's say 4.\n2. MexicanTruck: Not much preference, let's say 2.\n3. LebaneseTruck: Liked a lot, let's say 6.\n\nNow, let's consider the student's initial beliefs about what's behind the building. At the very start, the student can see the LebaneseTruck. The trucks could appear on either parking lot, hence the possibility is equal between KoreanTruck, MexicanTruck, and LebaneseTruck. \n\n1.  MexicanTruck: 4 (There is a good chance the student assumes a truck appears on either side)\n2.  LebaneseTruck: 3 (Since the truck appears near the student, the student might believe there is less likely to have another truck at the other side).\n3.  No Truck: 3 (It's possible)\n\nFinal Answer: [4, 2, 6, 4, 3, 3]\nAnswer: [4, 2, 6, 4, 3, 3]",

The student moves left again, getting closer to the truck. At no point does the student observe the food truck at the bottom, nor does the student state any preferences for any food truck.\n\nSince the agent only has an opportunity to observe KoreanTruck, it makes sense for their preference of KoreanTruck to be moderate, and the other trucks to be neutral. The location of KoreanTruck is also fully known, and since only one truck can be assigned to one parking lot, the other parking lot must either contain LebaneseTruck or be empty. Let's assume they think it's slightly more likely to be empty because there are only two trucks.\n[4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 6]\nAnswer: [4, 4, 4, 1, 3, 6]",

Let's assume that the student has no inherent preference and that the trucks are equally likely to be anywhere. Therefore, we will assign neutral likert scores (4) for their preferences.
