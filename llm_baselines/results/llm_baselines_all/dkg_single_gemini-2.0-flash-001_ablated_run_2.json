Since the player picked up the red key, gem A is a likely target.\n\n*   **Gem B:** Requires two red doors at (4,8) and (4,9) to be unlocked. The location of the player and the red key at (1,6) make it very unlikely that the player is heading to get gem B.\n\n*   **Gem C:** Requires two blue doors at (6,2) and (6,3) to be unlocked. The player moving up and picking up the red key at (1,6) makes it very unlikely that the player is heading to get gem C.\n\n*   **Gem D:** Requires a blue door at (7,6) to be unlocked. The player moving up and picking up the red key at (1,6) makes it very unlikely that the player is heading to get gem D.\n\nTherefore, the player is most likely trying to collect gem A.\n\nAnswer: [90, 5, 5, 0]",

However, to reach Gem C, the player would need a blue key and a red key, and the player is not heading toward any of them.
