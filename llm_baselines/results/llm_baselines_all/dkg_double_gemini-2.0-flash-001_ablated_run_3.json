Key7 is blue.\n\nLet's analyze each gem:\n\n*   **Gem A:** Requires opening one blue door. Two blue keys are required to open it. Possible, but requires a detour to the north.\n*   **Gem B:** Requires opening two blue doors. Four blue keys are required. The player has only one blue key now. So it is unlikely.\n*   **Gem C:** Requires opening one blue door and one red door. Two blue keys and two red keys are needed. The player has one blue key and needs at least one more.\n*   **Gem D:** Requires opening one red door, which has xloc as 4 and yloc as 9. Since the player is at (9,7) and picks up key7, it's likely that the player moves left to (9,4) to try to open the red door. Gem D requires two red keys.\n\nBased on the above analysis:\nIt is relatively difficult to say based on the current observations. Gem D would involve unlocking the immediately adjacent door and is thus slightly more likely at this point. Gem A and Gem C are still possible, but not immediately adjacent.

Also, it's more likely to be D because two actions are \"pickup\", which means the keys are collected. Now let's reconsider GemB, it has one blue door.
