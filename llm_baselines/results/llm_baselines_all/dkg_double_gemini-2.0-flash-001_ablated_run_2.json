Requires the player to open two blue doors.\n- Gem C: Requires the player to go to the right side of the map.

However, key7 is in the bottom right area, which seems closer to gem C. Also, now the player is at (5,7) and near to the east-west corridor where Gems B and C are located, which makes gem A less likely.\n\nBased on the player's current location and actions, let's consider the likelihood of each gem being the target:\n\n*   **Gem A:** The player would need to go north and then east. Since the player went south first, it's less likely that gemA is the goal.\n*   **Gem B:** The player would need to go west. It is possible.\n*   **Gem C:** The player would need to go east. It is possible.\n*   **Gem D:** The player would need to go west and then south. Since the player went south first, it's less likely that gemD is the goal. Also gem D is not on the map in initial state, making it unlikely.\n\nThe actions suggest that the player wants to collect a gem that requires blue keys. Since the player picked up a blue key and is located near the horizontal corridor leading to B and C, and gem B and gem C require the blue keys, we can predict that the player might be going for gem B or gem C.

It could be gem B if they collect the remaining blue key. However, the initial move is far away from gem-B. If they were going for Gem C, it is not optimal to first pick up the blue key.
