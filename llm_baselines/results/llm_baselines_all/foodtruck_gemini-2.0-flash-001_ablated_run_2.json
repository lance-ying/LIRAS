Since there are three trucks, the student must have some initial belief about the location of the MexicanTruck. Since we are asked to provide our belief that it is the MexicanTruck, LebaneseTruck or No Truck, the third option is that there is No Truck, implying that the MexicanTruck is not present. With no information, the student likely has a neutral belief about which truck is behind the building, so we can choose 4 for each of the trucks. The student moved toward the KoreanTruck after being able to see the trucks.\n\nBased on this, we can assume the student likes the Korean truck most and the LebaneseTruck least. For example:\n1. KoreanTruck: 6\n2. MexicanTruck: 4\n3. LebaneseTruck: 2\n\nAnd the initial belief:\n1. MexicanTruck: 4\n2. LebaneseTruck: 4\n3. No Truck: 4\n\nAnswer: [6, 4, 2, 4, 4, 4]",
  "foodtruck_67": "The student starts at (2, 14). They can see the KoreanTruck at (1, 1). They take one action, right-white(student), moving to (2, 15). The LebaneseTruck is at (5, 15). Since there's no information about the student's preferences for the trucks or their beliefs about the truck behind the building, we must make a reasonable assumption. Let's assume the student has a slight preference for all the trucks. Also, with no additional information, the student is equally likely to believe any of the trucks or no truck to be behind the buildings. Therefore, we'll assign a moderate likelihood to each possibility.\n\n1. KoreanTruck: 5\n2. MexicanTruck: 5\n3. LebaneseTruck: 5\n4. MexicanTruck: 4\n5. LebaneseTruck: 4\n6. No Truck: 4\n\nAnswer: [5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 4]",
  "foodtruck_68": "Okay, let's analyze the situation.\n\nThe student starts at (2, 2) and can see that KoreanTruck is at (1, 1). There's a long building blocking the view of the bottom parking lot at (5, 15). The student takes the following actions:\n\n1.  left-white(student): moves to (2, 1)\n2.  down-white(student): moves to (3, 1), but this location is within the buildings. So the agent must have failed.\n3.  down-white(student): moves to (4, 1)\n4.  down-white(student): moves to (5, 1)\n5.  up-white(student): moves to (4, 1)\n6.  up-white(student): moves to (3, 1), but this location is within the buildings. So the agent must have failed.\n7.  up-white(student): moves to (2, 1)\n\nBecause the actions involving moving the agent within the building are not possible. The true path of the agent should have been:\n\n1.  left-white(student): moves to (2, 1)\n2.  down-white(student): FAILS\n3.  down-white(student): moves to (4, 1)\n4.  up-white(student): moves to (4, 1)\n5.  up-white(student): FAILS\n6.  up-white(student): moves to (2, 1)\n\nThe student ends up back where they started and hasn't gained any new information about the food trucks. Their initial position puts them closer to the known Korean Truck. Since the student did not go to the parking lot at the south of the map, then the student might like Korean truck more, and have a neutral view on the other food trucks.\n\nAt the beginning, since the student is at (2, 2), and there is nothing to tell the student whether a food truck is present at the south parking lot. Therefore, we can assume a neutral point of view.\n\nSo, the answer should be:\n\nAnswer: [5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]",
  "foodtruck_69": "The student starts near the KoreanTruck. The student moves up and then left. This doesn't give us more information about their preferences. Since we don't have video evidence, we can assume neutral preferences. As for what they initially believed was behind the buildings, there is no particular reason to believe any of the trucks or no truck with higher probability than others, so we assign them a middle value.\n\nAnswer: [4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]",
  "foodtruck_70": "Okay, let's analyze the situation. The student starts at (2, 2) and sees the KoreanTruck at the parking lot at (1, 1). The other parking lot at (5, 15) is hidden behind the long building.

We can set all the likert values to 4.\n\nInitially, the student doesn't know which truck is behind the building. So, any of the trucks or no truck at all could be there. We'll assign a slightly higher probability to \"no truck\" because if either of the trucks had shown up, it would probably have shown up at the parking spot that is closest to the campus. But let us keep the answer a little bit neutral.\n\nSo, the student's preferences are [4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3].\n\nAnswer: [4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3]",
  "foodtruck_71": "The student moves to the left and then down, up and up again. The student seems curious about the other foodtruck, and they don't have much basis to prefer one truck over another at the beginning. So all foodtrucks have a medium rating. Since there is no truck shown at the bottom, there is no reason to believe it is more likely to be one truck over another. Thus, we would expect the student to think it is most likely that there is no truck there.\n\n[4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 7]\nAnswer: [4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 7]",

Also, they never saw what's in the bottom right parking lot because of the building so they don't know what's there. We can assume they like the KoreanTruck the most, followed by Mexican and Lebanese.\n\nSince the student chose to go to the Korean truck after exploring a little, we can say that they prefer the Korean truck. We will give KoreanTruck a rating of 6.\nSince the student's movement didn't reveal any new information about the other food trucks, we can assume that the Mexican and Lebanese trucks are somewhat equal, and slightly disliked given that the student decided to visit the Korean truck instead. We can give MexicanTruck a rating of 3 and LebaneseTruck a rating of 2.\n\nInitially, the student knows that the KoreanTruck is parked at parkinglot1, and that parkinglot2 is blocked from view. Without additional information, there isn't a strong reason to believe that Mexican, Lebanese, or No Truck is more likely than others. The student might have a slight bias toward \"No Truck\" as both other trucks are present on campus, but only one truck can occupy a parking spot. So, we can assign a value of 3 for MexicanTruck, 3 for LebaneseTruck and 4 for No Truck.\n\nAnswer: [6, 3, 2, 3, 3, 4]",

We can assume the student likes KoreanTruck reasonably well. Since the student doesn't have any information about the other trucks, we can assume the student has neutral opinions on them. As for what they initially believe was behind the buildings, there's no reason for the student to assume anything about what is in the other parking spot.

Since the student moves closer to the right-bottom parking lot, we can infer that they are more likely to be interested in the food truck that might be there. Since we do not know the student's preference for each of the three food trucks, we will assume a neutral preference. Therefore, we will set all the food truck likert values to 4. Initially, the student is in the middle of the grid and blocked from seeing the truck to the South-East so there is no way to know the probability of each truck behind the buildings.

We don't know anything about the student's preference for MexicanTruck or LebaneseTruck, so we will assign a value of 4 (neutral).\n\nInitially, the student is at (2, 14), and they cannot see what is in the bottom right parking lot due to the building blocking the view.
