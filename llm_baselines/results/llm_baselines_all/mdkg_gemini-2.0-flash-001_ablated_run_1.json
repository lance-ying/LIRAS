Now the fact that the robot picks up the blue key after already being in a location more appropriate for gems C or D, and heads up the board, suggests that it is heading toward gem A and using key3 to get to it. Since GemB and GemC require both keys (red and blue), and the robot picks up the blue key AFTER the human picks up the red key, this suggests the goal is not Gems B or C. The robot having key3 means that the team is committed to getting gem A, which the human can obtain once the robot unlocks the door.\n\nTherefore, the goal is most likely Gem A.\n\nAnswer: [90, 5, 5, 0]",
  "mdkg_26": "The human starts at (2,3) and picks up the red key3 at (4,5). It then moves down to (9,5).\nGem A is behind a blue door.\nGem B is directly accessible.\nGem C is behind a red door.\nGem D is behind a red and a blue door.\n\nSince the human picked up a red key, the goal is either Gem C or Gem D. The human is closer to Gem C than Gem D. The human moves down closer to gem C.\n\nTherefore, the human is most likely trying to collect Gem C. It is possible that they are trying to collect Gem D, but it is slightly less likely since they picked up a red key, and Gem D also requires a blue key. Gem A and Gem B are unlikely.\n\n[5, 5, 80, 10]\nAnswer: [5,5,80,10]",
  "mdkg_27": "The human starts at (2,3). The robot is at (7,6).\n\nThe human goes down to (3,3), then down to (4,3), then right to (4,4), then right to (4,5), then down to (5,5). At (5,5), the human picks up key3, which is a red key.\n\nThen, the human goes down to (6,5), down to (7,5), down to (8,5), down to (9,5). Then the human goes left to (9,4).\n\nFrom the initial state and the actions, the human picks up the red key at (4,5).\nGem A requires going up and right from human initial position.\nGem B requires going down and left from human initial position.\nGem C requires going down and left from human initial position.\nGem D requires going down and right from human initial position.\n\nGiven that the human went down towards the lower part of the grid, we can exclude Gem A. Since the human picked up the red key located at (4,5) and moved down towards Gem C and Gem D, and gem B has both a red door and blue door while Gem C only has a red door, it is likely they are going to collect either Gem C or D. Since there exists a path towards Gem C only by unlocking the red door, Gem C is slightly more probable than Gem D.\n\nGiven the agent is going downwards and slightly towards left side, we may rank them as GemC > GemB > GemD > GemA.\n\nAnswer: [5, 30, 40, 25]",
  "mdkg_28": "The human starts at (2,3). The actions taken are down, down, right, right, right, right. Thus the human's current location is (4,7).\nGem A is at (2,10) and requires a blue key to unlock door1 at (2,9). The blue key is at (1,8).\nGem B is at (7,1).\nGem C is at (9,1).\nGem D is at (9,10).\nThe robot is at (7,6).\nThe human is at (4,7).\n\nThe human is at (4,7). Key2 which is red is at (4,5), which the human could easily have picked up when moving to (4,7), so let's consider this possiblity:\nIf human picks up key2, then they can't reach A,C or D without the robot's help.\nKey1 (blue) is at (1,8), so the robot would need to move up and left to get it to help the human get A.\nTo reach gem C, human would have to navigate to 9,1.\nTo reach gem D, human would have to navigate to 9,10.\n\nThe optimal action to reach Gem A requires the robot to obtain Key1 and unlock Door1, which would then let the human easily pick up Gem A.\nHowever, to get to gems C and D the human and robot are quite far away, thus we can estimate gem A is where the agents are working to collect.\n\n```\nAnswer: [90, 5, 5, 0]\n```",
  "mdkg_29": "The human starts at (4,9). The robot starts at (6,11).\nGem A is at (1,11), gem B is at (4,1), and gem C is at (6,1).\n\nThe human moves left four times, and up once. The robot moves left five times and down twice.\nThe human is now at (4, 5). The robot is now at (4,6).\nThe human needs to get to gem A, gem B, or gem C.\n\nTo reach gem A at (1,11), the human needs to go left to column 6, then up to row 1, then right to column 11. The green door at (5,6) will block the human. The red key at (1,6) must be picked up.\nTo reach gem B at (4,1), the human needs to go left to column 1. The blue door at (4,2) will block the human.\nTo reach gem C at (6,1), the human needs to go down to row 6 and left to column 1.\n\nThe human is currently at (4,5). The movements suggest that the human is going for either gem B or gem C. It is less likely the human is going for gem A since that would involve going the opposite way, plus picking up the red key.\nSince the robot moved to position (4, 6), it may be trying to get the green key to open the green door. If so, the human cannot move to gem B or C. The robot will also have to move further down to get to key2 at (9, 6). The robot does not seem to be moving towards key3 (9, 9) or key2 (9, 6).\n\nGiven the human's position at (4,5) after its moves, it is more likely that the human is trying to get gem B or gem C. Gem C is a bit lower, at row 6, than gem B, at row 4. Gem C also has no door blocking it. So gem C is more likely than gem B.\n\nGem A: 20\nGem B: 30\nGem C: 50\n\nAnswer: [20, 30, 50]",
