The path taken suggests the student likes KoreanTruck at least as much as LebaneseTruck.\n\n1. KoreanTruck: Since the student started near it, we can assume a base liking of maybe 4 or 5. Given the eventual return to the known truck it's safe to say they like this pretty well. Let's say 5.\n2. MexicanTruck: No information about the MexicanTruck is available, but one can suppose that the initial decision between walking to LebaneseTruck versus staying at KoreanTruck indicates the possibility of MexicanTruck being less liked. So a neutral value would be suitable. Let's say 4.\n3. LebaneseTruck: The student showed some interest by walking towards it, but the return to the KoreanTruck indicates it's not preferred. Let's say 4.\n\nNow, for the initial beliefs about what was behind the building:\n1. MexicanTruck: Since it wasn't explicitly placed, a slightly less likely option. Let's say 3.\n2.

The student is in row 2, so they cannot see over the building.\n\nSince the student ends up at (2,15), and they could have gone to the Korean truck immediately, this suggests the student doesn't really like Korean food, and is curious about what could be on the other side of the building. Given that the student moves towards the Lebanese truck, there must be some positive affinity for that food.

The MexicanTruck might seem less likely, since it is the only one of the three that the student cannot see right away. Let's assume that initially, the student thinks it's most likely that there is no truck, followed by the MexicanTruck, given that the LebaneseTruck is on the right and the KoreanTruck is on the left.\n\nThus, the initial belief about the lower left could be:\n1. MexicanTruck: 3\n2. No truck at all: 6\n\nCombining all the numbers:\n[2, 1, 6, 3, 7, 6]\n\nAnswer: [2, 1, 6, 3, 6, 6]",

MexicanTruck: The student did not move towards the right-most truck initially, we can assume the student doesn't like it as much as the KoreanTruck, but they also didn't move straight to the KoreanTruck, it might mean they like MexicanTruck a bit. Let's assign 4 to it.\n3.  LebaneseTruck: The student moved away from the LebaneseTruck, indicating they dislike it. Let's set it to 2.\n\nInitial Beliefs:\n1. MexicanTruck: Since the student moved initially to the left, which mean they were considering the KoreanTruck, and we know they didn't move down, the likelihood they consider the possibility of MexicanTruck is low. Let's set it to 2.\n2. LebaneseTruck: The student could see the LebaneseTruck, so it is not behind the building. So, the likelihood is low. Let's set it to 1.\n3.

We don't know how much the student likes Korean or Mexican, so let's assign them a neutral 4. At the beginning, since the student does not see anything behind the building, each option is equally likely.

Therefore, the student likes the Korean truck more than the Lebanese truck. Since we do not have any information about whether the student like the trucks, we'll put them all in the middle to be safe.\nInitially, the student is far away from the bottom parking lot.

LebaneseTruck is far. Since the student moves left a lot, and then down, we can infer that they don't like KoreanTruck much but want to explore the possibility of going to the LebaneseTruck. Let's say the student likes KoreanTruck 2, MexicanTruck 4 and LebaneseTruck 5.\n\nInitially, the student cannot see what is behind the building, and any truck might be behind it.
