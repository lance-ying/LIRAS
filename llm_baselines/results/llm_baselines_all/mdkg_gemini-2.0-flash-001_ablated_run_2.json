However, given the initial location, to get to C or B, the human would also need to go down first, so we can't tell for sure.\nBut the fact that the robot gets the blue key makes gem A more probable.\n\nLikelihood:\nGem A: High (70) - The robot is picking up a blue key which can be used to get the gem.\nGem B: Low (10)\nGem C: Low (10)\nGem D: Medium (10) - The human is picking up the red key to get gem D, and the robot is picking up the blue key, and going down makes sense for gem D.\n\nAnswer: [70, 10, 10, 10]",
  "mdkg_26": "The human starts at (2,3) and picks up a red key at (4,5). Gems B and C are behind red doors. The human moves down towards gems B and C. Given this information, gems A and D are very unlikely to be the targets, while gems B and C are more likely. The human's current path strongly suggests either gem B or gem C as the target.\n\nAnswer: [0, 50, 50, 0]",
  "mdkg_27": "The human starts at (2,3) and picks up a red key (key3) at (4,5). Gem A is in the upper right corner and requires a blue key. Gem B is located at the bottom left and requires a red key and a blue key. Gem C is at the bottom left and requires a red key. Gem D is at the bottom right corner and requires a blue key and red key.\n\nThe human moves towards the bottom left of the grid after obtaining the red key. This makes Gem C and Gem B the most likely options. Since Gem B also requires a blue key to unlock the blue door, Gem C is more likely because the human did not pick up a blue key before heading towards the bottom left corner.\n\nTherefore, the probabilities are:\nGem A: Very unlikely because it requires the blue key, and the human player has instead picked up the red key.\nGem B: Possible since the human is moving toward Gem B and a red key is on the path. But a blue key is also required, making it less likely.\nGem C: Quite likely because it requires a red key, and the human player has already picked up the red key and is moving towards that area.\nGem D: Somewhat likely since it requires both red and blue keys. The human has a red key, and may attempt to get a blue key on the way.\n\nBased on this assessment:\n\nAnswer: [5, 30, 60, 5]",
  "mdkg_28": "The human agent starts at (2,3). Gem A is located at (2,10) and requires a blue key to open the door at (2,9). The human agent moves down twice to (4,3) and then moves right 4 times to (4,7). A blue key is located at (1,8). Gem D is located at (9,10) and requires a blue key. The human agent is initially heading towards the right of the grid.\n\nConsidering the initial moves of the human agent, gem A is the most probable goal because it is in the direction in which the agent is moving. Gem D is also possible, as there is a blue key nearby and it's on the right side. Gems B and C are less likely because they are to the left of the agent's starting position.\n\nBased on the agent's movement towards the right side of the grid, gem A seems the most probable.\n\nAnswer: [90, 5, 5, 0]",
  "mdkg_29": "The human starts at (4, 9). The robot starts at (6, 11). The human moves left 5 times to (4,4). The robot moves left 5 times, down twice to (4,6).
