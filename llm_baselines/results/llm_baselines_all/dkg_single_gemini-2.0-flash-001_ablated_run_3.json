The player has the red key now, and can easily reach gem A.\nGem B is at (4,10) and requires the player to unlock two red doors at (4,8) and (4,9). The player doesn't have immediate access to the gem.\nGem C is at (6,1) and requires the player to unlock two blue doors at (6,2) and (6,3). The player doesn't have the blue key now.\nGem D is at (8,6) and requires the player to unlock a blue door at (7,6). The player doesn't have the blue key now.\n\nSince the player picked up a red key at (1,6) after going up and right a couple of times, it is most likely the player is targeting Gem A or Gem B. Gem A is closer and requires only one red key to unlock the red door.\nThus, it is very likely the goal is Gem A.\n\nAnswer: [90, 10, 0, 0]",

It seems plausible that the player wants to collect gem A.\n\nGem B is located at (5, 1) and blocked by a blue door at (5, 2) and a red door at (5, 3). The player has obtained a red key, and getting to gem B is possible. However, to collect gem B the player also needs to get to the location of the blue key (either (1,4) or (2,1)).\n\nGem C is located at (7, 1) and is blocked by a blue door at (7, 2). The player has obtained a red key, so getting to gem C is not possible unless the player takes a detour and get a blue key (either (1,4) or (2,1)).\n\nGiven the current actions, Gem A is the most likely goal, with a lower probability for Gem B and a much lower probability for Gem C.\n\nAnswer: [80, 15, 5]",

  "dkg_single_29": "The player starts at (7, 8) and moves to (9, 6). This indicates that the player is going for either gem-D or the two blue keys at the bottom. Based on the initial locations of the gems, keys and doors, we can infer:\n*   Gem A requires two blue keys, which are located at the bottom of the grid.\n*   Gem B requires a yellow key and a blue key.\n*   Gem C requires a yellow key.\n*   Gem D requires one blue key.\n\nGiven the moves down and left, it seems more probable that the agent wants to collect the two keys at (9,4) and (9,5). Collecting these two keys and then heading for Gem A seems like a very high cost action. More probably, the agent wants to pick up the two keys at the bottom, then unlock door D.\n\nTherefore, it is most likely the agent wants to pick Gem D.\n\nAnswer: [5, 5, 5, 85]",
