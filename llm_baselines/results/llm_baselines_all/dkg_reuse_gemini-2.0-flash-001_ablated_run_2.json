Gem A requires picking up key3 which is a blue key at (1,11) and unlocking a blue door. This is far away. Gem B requires picking up key5 or key6 which are blue keys at (6,2) and (6,3) respectively and unlocking a blue door. This is also far away. Gem C requires picking up key7 which is a blue key at (6,10) and unlocking door1 which is a blue door. The player is heading in that direction. Gem D is next to key10, a blue key at (10,4).\n\nThe player's initial actions don't immediately favor any particular goal, but the fact that the player picked up key11 which is a blue key at (10,7), makes it more likely that the player may want to unlock gem C because one possible path to unlock gem C is picking up key7 and unlocking a door. Because the player started moving down and picked up the key, it suggests that the player might be going to gem D.\n\nLet's look at the keys required to get to each of the gems.\nGem A needs blue keys. Player has not picked up blue keys near A.\nGem B needs blue keys. Player has not picked up blue keys near B.\nGem C needs blue keys. Player has picked up a blue key (key11).\nGem D needs blue keys. Player has picked up a blue key (key11).\n\nBased on the actions, gem C or gem D is most likely. Since the key11 and gemD are in the same direction, we assign a slightly higher probability to gem D\n\n[10, 10, 30, 50]\n[10, 10, 40, 40] - player has taken key11 down south so heading toward gem D is just as probable as heading right to key7 and subsequently gem C.\n\nAnswer: [10, 10, 40, 40]",

It's located on a black square in the initial state, so it's not possible to reach.\n\nGiven the current actions, gems B and C are most likely.

Given that the player picked up a red key, and both Gem A and Gem B require a red key, these are the most likely goals. The player's current position is relatively equidistant from gems A and B, although gem A is closer.\nHowever, Gem C requires a blue key, which the player has not obtained and requires more actions than going for Gem A and Gem B. Gem D is not accessible.\n\nGiven the player's moves, picking up the red key, and location, it is most likely that the player is going for Gem A or Gem B.
